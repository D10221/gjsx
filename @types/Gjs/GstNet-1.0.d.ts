 * GstPtpClock implements a PTP (IEEE1588:2008) ordinary clock in slave-only

 * clock in some specific domain.
 * 
 * The PTP subsystem can be initialized with gst_ptp_init(), which then starts
 * a helper process to do the actual communication via the PTP ports. This is
 * required as PTP listens on ports < 1024 and thus requires special
 * privileges. Once this helper process is started, the main process will
 * synchronize to all PTP domains that are detected on the selected
 * interfaces.
 * 
 * gst_ptp_clock_new() then allows to create a GstClock that provides the PTP
 * time from a master clock inside a specific PTP domain. This clock will only
 * return valid timestamps once the timestamps in the PTP domain are known. To
 * check this, you can use gst_clock_wait_for_sync(), the GstClock::synced
 * signal and gst_clock_is_synced().
 * 
 * To gather statistics about the PTP clock synchronization,
 * gst_ptp_statistics_callback_add() can be used. This gives the application
 * the possibility to collect all kinds of statistics from the clock
 * synchronization.
