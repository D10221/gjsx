/**
 * This class is for elements that receive buffers in an undesired size.
 * While for example raw video contains one image per buffer, the same is not
 * true for a lot of other formats, especially those that come directly from
 * a file. So if you have undefined buffer sizes and require a specific size,
 * this object is for you.
 * 
 * An adapter is created with gst_adapter_new(). It can be freed again with
 * g_object_unref().
 * 
 * The theory of operation is like this: All buffers received are put
 * into the adapter using gst_adapter_push() and the data is then read back
 * in chunks of the desired size using gst_adapter_map()/gst_adapter_unmap()
 * and/or gst_adapter_copy(). After the data has been processed, it is freed
 * using gst_adapter_unmap().
 * 
 * Other methods such as gst_adapter_take() and gst_adapter_take_buffer()
 * combine gst_adapter_map() and gst_adapter_unmap() in one method and are
 * potentially more convenient for some use cases.
 * 
 * For example, a sink pad's chain function that needs to pass data to a library
 * in 512-byte chunks could be implemented like this:
 * 
 * ```c
 * static GstFlowReturn
 * sink_pad_chain (GstPad *pad, GstObject *parent, GstBuffer *buffer)
 * {
 *   MyElement *this;
 *   GstAdapter *adapter;
 *   GstFlowReturn ret = GST_FLOW_OK;
 * 
 *   this = MY_ELEMENT (parent);
 * 
 *   adapter = this->adapter;
 * 
 *   // put buffer into adapter
 *   gst_adapter_push (adapter, buffer);
 * 
 *   // while we can read out 512 bytes, process them
 *   while (gst_adapter_available (adapter) >= 512 && ret == GST_FLOW_OK) {
 *     const guint8 *data = gst_adapter_map (adapter, 512);
 *     // use flowreturn as an error value
 *     ret = my_library_foo (data);
 *     gst_adapter_unmap (adapter);
 *     gst_adapter_flush (adapter, 512);
 *   }
 *   return ret;
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * 
 * For another example, a simple element inside GStreamer that uses #GstAdapter
 * is the libvisual element.
 * 
 * An element using #GstAdapter in its sink pad chain function should ensure that
 * when the FLUSH_STOP event is received, that any queued data is cleared using
 * gst_adapter_clear(). Data should also be cleared or processed on EOS and
 * when changing state from %GST_STATE_PAUSED to %GST_STATE_READY.
 * 
 * Also check the GST_BUFFER_FLAG_DISCONT flag on the buffer. Some elements might
 * need to clear the adapter after a discontinuity.
 * 
 * The adapter will keep track of the timestamps of the buffers
 * that were pushed. The last seen timestamp before the current position
 * can be queried with gst_adapter_prev_pts(). This function can
 * optionally return the number of bytes between the start of the buffer that
 * carried the timestamp and the current adapter position. The distance is
 * useful when dealing with, for example, raw audio samples because it allows
 * you to calculate the timestamp of the current adapter position by using the
 * last seen timestamp and the amount of bytes since.  Additionally, the
 * gst_adapter_prev_pts_at_offset() can be used to determine the last
 * seen timestamp at a particular offset in the adapter.
 * 
 * The adapter will also keep track of the offset of the buffers
 * (#GST_BUFFER_OFFSET) that were pushed. The last seen offset before the
 * current position can be queried with gst_adapter_prev_offset(). This function
 * can optionally return the number of bytes between the start of the buffer
 * that carried the offset and the current adapter position.
 * 
 * Additionally the adapter also keeps track of the PTS, DTS and buffer offset
 * at the last discontinuity, which can be retrieved with
 * gst_adapter_pts_at_discont(), gst_adapter_dts_at_discont() and
 * gst_adapter_offset_at_discont(). The number of bytes that were consumed
 * since then can be queried with gst_adapter_distance_from_discont().
 * 
 * A last thing to note is that while #GstAdapter is pretty optimized,
 * merging buffers still might be an operation that requires a malloc() and
 * memcpy() operation, and these operations are not the fastest. Because of
 * this, some functions like gst_adapter_available_fast() are provided to help
 * speed up such cases should you want to. To avoid repeated memory allocations,
 * gst_adapter_copy() can be used to copy data into a (statically allocated)
 * user provided buffer.
 * 
 * #GstAdapter is not MT safe. All operations on an adapter must be serialized by
 * the caller. This is not normally a problem, however, as the normal use case
 * of #GstAdapter is inside one pad's chain function, in which case access is
 * serialized via the pad's STREAM_LOCK.
 * 
 * Note that gst_adapter_push() takes ownership of the buffer passed. Use
 * gst_buffer_ref() before pushing it into the adapter if you still want to
 * access the buffer later. The adapter will never modify the data in the
 * buffer pushed in it.

     * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
     * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
     * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
     * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
     * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
     * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
     * 
     * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
     * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
     * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
     * 
     * ```c
     * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",
     *                   G_CALLBACK (gtk_text_view_target_list_notify),
     *                   text_view)
     * ```
     * 
     * It is important to note that you must use
     * [canonical parameter names][canonical-parameter-names] as
     * detail strings for the notify signal.
     * @signal 
     * @param pspec the #GParamSpec of the property which changed.

 *   * can operate in pull mode or push mode
 *   * handles seeking in both modes
 *   * handles events (SEGMENT/EOS/FLUSH)
 *   * handles queries (POSITION/DURATION/SEEKING/FORMAT/CONVERT)
 *   * handles flushing
 * 
 * The purpose of this base class is to provide the basic functionality of
 * a parser and share a lot of rather complex code.
 * 
 * # Description of the parsing mechanism:
 * 
 * ## Set-up phase
 * 
 *  * #GstBaseParse calls #GstBaseParseClass.start() to inform subclass
 *    that data processing is about to start now.
 * 
 *  * #GstBaseParse class calls #GstBaseParseClass.set_sink_caps() to
 *    inform the subclass about incoming sinkpad caps. Subclass could
 *    already set the srcpad caps accordingly, but this might be delayed
 *    until calling gst_base_parse_finish_frame() with a non-queued frame.
 * 
 *  * At least at this point subclass needs to tell the #GstBaseParse class
 *    how big data chunks it wants to receive (minimum frame size ). It can
 *    do this with gst_base_parse_set_min_frame_size().
 * 
 *  * #GstBaseParse class sets up appropriate data passing mode (pull/push)
 *    and starts to process the data.
 * 
 * ## Parsing phase
 * 
 *  * #GstBaseParse gathers at least min_frame_size bytes of data either
 *    by pulling it from upstream or collecting buffers in an internal
 *    #GstAdapter.
 * 
 *  * A buffer of (at least) min_frame_size bytes is passed to subclass
 *    with #GstBaseParseClass.handle_frame(). Subclass checks the contents
 *    and can optionally return #GST_FLOW_OK along with an amount of data
 *    to be skipped to find a valid frame (which will result in a
 *    subsequent DISCONT).  If, otherwise, the buffer does not hold a
 *    complete frame, #GstBaseParseClass.handle_frame() can merely return
 *    and will be called again when additional data is available.  In push
 *    mode this amounts to an additional input buffer (thus minimal
 *    additional latency), in pull mode this amounts to some arbitrary
 *    reasonable buffer size increase.
 * 
 *    Of course, gst_base_parse_set_min_frame_size() could also be used if
 *    a very specific known amount of additional data is required.  If,
 *    however, the buffer holds a complete valid frame, it can pass the
 *    size of this frame to gst_base_parse_finish_frame().
 * 
 *    If acting as a converter, it can also merely indicate consumed input
 *    data while simultaneously providing custom output data.  Note that
 *    baseclass performs some processing (such as tracking overall consumed
 *    data rate versus duration) for each finished frame, but other state
 *    is only updated upon each call to #GstBaseParseClass.handle_frame()
 *    (such as tracking upstream input timestamp).
 * 
 *    Subclass is also responsible for setting the buffer metadata
 *    (e.g. buffer timestamp and duration, or keyframe if applicable).
 *    (although the latter can also be done by #GstBaseParse if it is
 *    appropriately configured, see below).  Frame is provided with
 *    timestamp derived from upstream (as much as generally possible),
 *    duration obtained from configuration (see below), and offset
 *    if meaningful (in pull mode).
 * 
 *    Note that #GstBaseParseClass.handle_frame() might receive any small
 *    amount of input data when leftover data is being drained (e.g. at
 *    EOS).
 * 
 *  * As part of finish frame processing, just prior to actually pushing
 *    the buffer in question, it is passed to
 *    #GstBaseParseClass.pre_push_frame() which gives subclass yet one last
 *    chance to examine buffer metadata, or to send some custom (tag)
 *    events, or to perform custom (segment) filtering.
 * 
 *  * During the parsing process #GstBaseParseClass will handle both srcpad
 *    and sinkpad events. They will be passed to subclass if
 *    #GstBaseParseClass.event() or #GstBaseParseClass.src_event()
 *    implementations have been provided.
 * 
 * ## Shutdown phase
 * 
 * * #GstBaseParse class calls #GstBaseParseClass.stop() to inform the
 *   subclass that data parsing will be stopped.
 * 
 * Subclass is responsible for providing pad template caps for source and
 * sink pads. The pads need to be named "sink" and "src". It also needs to
 * set the fixed caps on srcpad, when the format is ensured (e.g.  when
 * base class calls subclass' #GstBaseParseClass.set_sink_caps() function).
 * 
 * This base class uses %GST_FORMAT_DEFAULT as a meaning of frames. So,
 * subclass conversion routine needs to know that conversion from
 * %GST_FORMAT_TIME to %GST_FORMAT_DEFAULT must return the
 * frame number that can be found from the given byte position.
 * 
 * #GstBaseParse uses subclasses conversion methods also for seeking (or
 * otherwise uses its own default one, see also below).
 * 
 * Subclass `start` and `stop` functions will be called to inform the beginning
 * and end of data processing.
 * 
 * Things that subclass need to take care of:
 * 
 * * Provide pad templates
 * * Fixate the source pad caps when appropriate
 * * Inform base class how big data chunks should be retrieved. This is
 *   done with gst_base_parse_set_min_frame_size() function.
 * * Examine data chunks passed to subclass with
 *   #GstBaseParseClass.handle_frame() and pass proper frame(s) to
 *   gst_base_parse_finish_frame(), and setting src pad caps and timestamps
 *   on frame.
 * * Provide conversion functions
 * * Update the duration information with gst_base_parse_set_duration()
 * * Optionally passthrough using gst_base_parse_set_passthrough()
 * * Configure various baseparse parameters using
 *   gst_base_parse_set_average_bitrate(), gst_base_parse_set_syncable()
 *   and gst_base_parse_set_frame_rate().
 * 
 * * In particular, if subclass is unable to determine a duration, but
 *   parsing (or specs) yields a frames per seconds rate, then this can be
 *   provided to #GstBaseParse to enable it to cater for buffer time
 *   metadata (which will be taken from upstream as much as
 *   possible). Internally keeping track of frame durations and respective
 *   sizes that have been pushed provides #GstBaseParse with an estimated
 *   bitrate. A default #GstBaseParseClass.convert() (used if not
 *   overridden) will then use these rates to perform obvious conversions.
 *   These rates are also used to update (estimated) duration at regular
 *   frame intervals.

/**
 * #GstBaseSink is the base class for sink elements in GStreamer, such as
 * xvimagesink or filesink. It is a layer on top of #GstElement that provides a
 * simplified interface to plugin writers. #GstBaseSink handles many details
 * for you, for example: preroll, clock synchronization, state changes,
 * activation in push or pull mode, and queries.
 * 
 * In most cases, when writing sink elements, there is no need to implement
 * class methods from #GstElement or to set functions on pads, because the
 * #GstBaseSink infrastructure should be sufficient.
 * 
 * #GstBaseSink provides support for exactly one sink pad, which should be
 * named "sink". A sink implementation (subclass of #GstBaseSink) should
 * install a pad template in its class_init function, like so:
 * 
 * ```c
 * static void
 * my_element_class_init (GstMyElementClass *klass)
 * {
 *   GstElementClass *gstelement_class = GST_ELEMENT_CLASS (klass);
 * 
 *   // sinktemplate should be a #GstStaticPadTemplate with direction
 *   // %GST_PAD_SINK and name "sink"
 *   gst_element_class_add_static_pad_template (gstelement_class, &amp;sinktemplate);
 * 
 *   gst_element_class_set_static_metadata (gstelement_class,
 *       "Sink name",
 *       "Sink",
 *       "My Sink element",
 *       "The author <my.sink`my`.email>");
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * 
 * #GstBaseSink will handle the prerolling correctly. This means that it will
 * return %GST_STATE_CHANGE_ASYNC from a state change to PAUSED until the first
 * buffer arrives in this element. The base class will call the
 * #GstBaseSinkClass.preroll() vmethod with this preroll buffer and will then
 * commit the state change to the next asynchronously pending state.
 * 
 * When the element is set to PLAYING, #GstBaseSink will synchronise on the
 * clock using the times returned from #GstBaseSinkClass.get_times(). If this
 * function returns %GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE for the start time, no synchronisation
 * will be done. Synchronisation can be disabled entirely by setting the object
 * #GstBaseSink:sync property to %FALSE.
 * 
 * After synchronisation the virtual method #GstBaseSinkClass.render() will be
 * called. Subclasses should minimally implement this method.
 * 
 * Subclasses that synchronise on the clock in the #GstBaseSinkClass.render()
 * method are supported as well. These classes typically receive a buffer in
 * the render method and can then potentially block on the clock while
 * rendering. A typical example is an audiosink.
 * These subclasses can use gst_base_sink_wait_preroll() to perform the
 * blocking wait.
 * 
 * Upon receiving the EOS event in the PLAYING state, #GstBaseSink will wait
 * for the clock to reach the time indicated by the stop time of the last
 * #GstBaseSinkClass.get_times() call before posting an EOS message. When the
 * element receives EOS in PAUSED, preroll completes, the event is queued and an
 * EOS message is posted when going to PLAYING.
 * 
 * #GstBaseSink will internally use the %GST_EVENT_SEGMENT events to schedule
 * synchronisation and clipping of buffers. Buffers that fall completely outside
 * of the current segment are dropped. Buffers that fall partially in the
 * segment are rendered (and prerolled). Subclasses should do any subbuffer
 * clipping themselves when needed.
 * 
 * #GstBaseSink will by default report the current playback position in
 * %GST_FORMAT_TIME based on the current clock time and segment information.
 * If no clock has been set on the element, the query will be forwarded
 * upstream.
 * 
 * The #GstBaseSinkClass.set_caps() function will be called when the subclass
 * should configure itself to process a specific media type.
 * 
 * The #GstBaseSinkClass.start() and #GstBaseSinkClass.stop() virtual methods
 * will be called when resources should be allocated. Any
 * #GstBaseSinkClass.preroll(), #GstBaseSinkClass.render() and
 * #GstBaseSinkClass.set_caps() function will be called between the
 * #GstBaseSinkClass.start() and #GstBaseSinkClass.stop() calls.
 * 
 * The #GstBaseSinkClass.event() virtual method will be called when an event is
 * received by #GstBaseSink. Normally this method should only be overridden by
 * very specific elements (such as file sinks) which need to handle the
 * newsegment event specially.
 * 
 * The #GstBaseSinkClass.unlock() method is called when the elements should
 * unblock any blocking operations they perform in the
 * #GstBaseSinkClass.render() method. This is mostly useful when the
 * #GstBaseSinkClass.render() method performs a blocking write on a file
 * descriptor, for example.
 * 
 * The #GstBaseSink:max-lateness property affects how the sink deals with
 * buffers that arrive too late in the sink. A buffer arrives too late in the
 * sink when the presentation time (as a combination of the last segment, buffer
 * timestamp and element base_time) plus the duration is before the current
 * time of the clock.
 * If the frame is later than max-lateness, the sink will drop the buffer
 * without calling the render method.
 * This feature is disabled if sync is disabled, the
 * #GstBaseSinkClass.get_times() method does not return a valid start time or
 * max-lateness is set to -1 (the default).
 * Subclasses can use gst_base_sink_set_max_lateness() to configure the
 * max-lateness value.
 * 
 * The #GstBaseSink:qos property will enable the quality-of-service features of
 * the basesink which gather statistics about the real-time performance of the
 * clock synchronisation. For each buffer received in the sink, statistics are
 * gathered and a QOS event is sent upstream with these numbers. This
 * information can then be used by upstream elements to reduce their processing
 * rate, for example.
 * 
 * The #GstBaseSink:async property can be used to instruct the sink to never
 * perform an ASYNC state change. This feature is mostly usable when dealing
 * with non-synchronized streams or sparse streams.

/**
 * This is a generic base class for source elements. The following
 * types of sources are supported:
 * 
 *   * random access sources like files
 *   * seekable sources
 *   * live sources
 * 
 * The source can be configured to operate in any #GstFormat with the
 * gst_base_src_set_format() method. The currently set format determines
 * the format of the internal #GstSegment and any %GST_EVENT_SEGMENT
 * events. The default format for #GstBaseSrc is %GST_FORMAT_BYTES.
 * 
 * #GstBaseSrc always supports push mode scheduling. If the following
 * conditions are met, it also supports pull mode scheduling:
 * 
 *   * The format is set to %GST_FORMAT_BYTES (default).
 *   * #GstBaseSrcClass.is_seekable() returns %TRUE.
 * 
 * If all the conditions are met for operating in pull mode, #GstBaseSrc is
 * automatically seekable in push mode as well. The following conditions must
 * be met to make the element seekable in push mode when the format is not
 * %GST_FORMAT_BYTES:
 * 
 * * #GstBaseSrcClass.is_seekable() returns %TRUE.
 * * #GstBaseSrcClass.query() can convert all supported seek formats to the
 *   internal format as set with gst_base_src_set_format().
 * * #GstBaseSrcClass.do_seek() is implemented, performs the seek and returns
 *    %TRUE.
 * 
 * When the element does not meet the requirements to operate in pull mode, the
 * offset and length in the #GstBaseSrcClass.create() method should be ignored.
 * It is recommended to subclass #GstPushSrc instead, in this situation. If the
 * element can operate in pull mode but only with specific offsets and
 * lengths, it is allowed to generate an error when the wrong values are passed
 * to the #GstBaseSrcClass.create() function.
 * 
 * #GstBaseSrc has support for live sources. Live sources are sources that when
 * paused discard data, such as audio or video capture devices. A typical live
 * source also produces data at a fixed rate and thus provides a clock to publish
 * this rate.
 * Use gst_base_src_set_live() to activate the live source mode.
 * 
 * A live source does not produce data in the PAUSED state. This means that the
 * #GstBaseSrcClass.create() method will not be called in PAUSED but only in
 * PLAYING. To signal the pipeline that the element will not produce data, the
 * return value from the READY to PAUSED state will be
 * %GST_STATE_CHANGE_NO_PREROLL.
 * 
 * A typical live source will timestamp the buffers it creates with the
 * current running time of the pipeline. This is one reason why a live source
 * can only produce data in the PLAYING state, when the clock is actually
 * distributed and running.
 * 
 * Live sources that synchronize and block on the clock (an audio source, for
 * example) can use gst_base_src_wait_playing() when the
 * #GstBaseSrcClass.create() function was interrupted by a state change to
 * PAUSED.
 * 
 * The #GstBaseSrcClass.get_times() method can be used to implement pseudo-live
 * sources. It only makes sense to implement the #GstBaseSrcClass.get_times()
 * function if the source is a live source. The #GstBaseSrcClass.get_times()
 * function should return timestamps starting from 0, as if it were a non-live
 * source. The base class will make sure that the timestamps are transformed
 * into the current running_time. The base source will then wait for the
 * calculated running_time before pushing out the buffer.
 * 
 * For live sources, the base class will by default report a latency of 0.
 * For pseudo live sources, the base class will by default measure the difference
 * between the first buffer timestamp and the start time of get_times and will
 * report this value as the latency.
 * Subclasses should override the query function when this behaviour is not
 * acceptable.
 * 
 * There is only support in #GstBaseSrc for exactly one source pad, which
 * should be named "src". A source implementation (subclass of #GstBaseSrc)
 * should install a pad template in its class_init function, like so:
 * 
 * ```c
 * static void
 * my_element_class_init (GstMyElementClass *klass)
 * {
 *   GstElementClass *gstelement_class = GST_ELEMENT_CLASS (klass);
 *   // srctemplate should be a #GstStaticPadTemplate with direction
 *   // %GST_PAD_SRC and name "src"
 *   gst_element_class_add_static_pad_template (gstelement_class, &amp;srctemplate);
 * 
 *   gst_element_class_set_static_metadata (gstelement_class,
 *      "Source name",
 *      "Source",
 *      "My Source element",
 *      "The author <my.sink`my`.email>");
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * 
 * ## Controlled shutdown of live sources in applications
 * 
 * Applications that record from a live source may want to stop recording
 * in a controlled way, so that the recording is stopped, but the data
 * already in the pipeline is processed to the end (remember that many live
 * sources would go on recording forever otherwise). For that to happen the
 * application needs to make the source stop recording and send an EOS
 * event down the pipeline. The application would then wait for an
 * EOS message posted on the pipeline's bus to know when all data has
 * been processed and the pipeline can safely be stopped.
 * 
 * An application may send an EOS event to a source element to make it
 * perform the EOS logic (send EOS event downstream or post a
 * %GST_MESSAGE_SEGMENT_DONE on the bus). This can typically be done
 * with the gst_element_send_event() function on the element or its parent bin.
 * 
 * After the EOS has been sent to the element, the application should wait for
 * an EOS message to be posted on the pipeline's bus. Once this EOS message is
 * received, it may safely shut down the entire pipeline.

/**
 * This base class is for filter elements that process data. Elements
 * that are suitable for implementation using #GstBaseTransform are ones
 * where the size and caps of the output is known entirely from the input
 * caps and buffer sizes. These include elements that directly transform
 * one buffer into another, modify the contents of a buffer in-place, as
 * well as elements that collate multiple input buffers into one output buffer,
 * or that expand one input buffer into multiple output buffers. See below
 * for more concrete use cases.
 * 
 * It provides for:
 * 
 * * one sinkpad and one srcpad
 * * Possible formats on sink and source pad implemented
 *   with custom transform_caps function. By default uses
 *   same format on sink and source.
 * 
 * * Handles state changes
 * * Does flushing
 * * Push mode
 * * Pull mode if the sub-class transform can operate on arbitrary data
 * 
 * # Use Cases
 * 
 * ## Passthrough mode
 * 
 *   * Element has no interest in modifying the buffer. It may want to inspect it,
 *     in which case the element should have a transform_ip function. If there
 *     is no transform_ip function in passthrough mode, the buffer is pushed
 *     intact.
 * 
 *   * The #GstBaseTransformClass.passthrough_on_same_caps variable
 *     will automatically set/unset passthrough based on whether the
 *     element negotiates the same caps on both pads.
 * 
 *   * #GstBaseTransformClass.passthrough_on_same_caps on an element that
 *     doesn't implement a transform_caps function is useful for elements that
 *     only inspect data (such as level)
 * 
 *   * Example elements
 * 
 *     * Level
 *     * Videoscale, audioconvert, videoconvert, audioresample in certain modes.
 * 
 * ## Modifications in-place - input buffer and output buffer are the same thing.
 * 
 * * The element must implement a transform_ip function.
 * * Output buffer size must <= input buffer size
 * * If the always_in_place flag is set, non-writable buffers will be copied
 *   and passed to the transform_ip function, otherwise a new buffer will be
 *   created and the transform function called.
 * 
 * * Incoming writable buffers will be passed to the transform_ip function
 *   immediately.
 * * only implementing transform_ip and not transform implies always_in_place = %TRUE
 * 
 *   * Example elements:
 *     * Volume
 *     * Audioconvert in certain modes (signed/unsigned conversion)
 *     * videoconvert in certain modes (endianness swapping)
 * 
 * ## Modifications only to the caps/metadata of a buffer
 * 
 * * The element does not require writable data, but non-writable buffers
 *   should be subbuffered so that the meta-information can be replaced.
 * 
 * * Elements wishing to operate in this mode should replace the
 *   prepare_output_buffer method to create subbuffers of the input buffer
 *   and set always_in_place to %TRUE
 * 
 * * Example elements
 *   * Capsfilter when setting caps on outgoing buffers that have
 *     none.
 *   * identity when it is going to re-timestamp buffers by
 *     datarate.
 * 
 * ## Normal mode
 *   * always_in_place flag is not set, or there is no transform_ip function
 *   * Element will receive an input buffer and output buffer to operate on.
 *   * Output buffer is allocated by calling the prepare_output_buffer function.
 *   * Example elements:
 *     * Videoscale, videoconvert, audioconvert when doing
 *     scaling/conversions
 * 
 * ## Special output buffer allocations
 *   * Elements which need to do special allocation of their output buffers
 *     beyond allocating output buffers via the negotiated allocator or
 *     buffer pool should implement the prepare_output_buffer method.
 * 
 *   * Example elements:
 *     * efence
 * 
 * # Sub-class settable flags on GstBaseTransform
 * 
 * * passthrough
 * 
 *   * Implies that in the current configuration, the sub-class is not interested in modifying the buffers.
 *   * Elements which are always in passthrough mode whenever the same caps has been negotiated on both pads can set the class variable passthrough_on_same_caps to have this behaviour automatically.
 * 
 * * always_in_place
 *   * Determines whether a non-writable buffer will be copied before passing
 *     to the transform_ip function.
 * 
 *   * Implied %TRUE if no transform function is implemented.
 *   * Implied %FALSE if ONLY transform function is implemented.

 * Utility struct to help handling #GstFlowReturn combination. Useful for

 * 
 * #GstFlowCombiner works by using the last #GstFlowReturn for all #GstPad
 * it has in its list and computes the combined return value and provides
 * it to the caller.
 * 
 * To add a new pad to the #GstFlowCombiner use gst_flow_combiner_add_pad().
 * The new #GstPad is stored with a default value of %GST_FLOW_OK.
 * 
 * In case you want a #GstPad to be removed, use gst_flow_combiner_remove_pad().
 * 
 * Please be aware that this struct isn't thread safe as its designed to be
 *  used by demuxers, those usually will have a single thread operating it.
 * 
 * These functions will take refs on the passed #GstPad<!-- -->s.
 * 
 * Aside from reducing the user's code size, the main advantage of using this
 * helper struct is to follow the standard rules for #GstFlowReturn combination.
 * These rules are:
 * 
 * * %GST_FLOW_EOS: only if all returns are EOS too
 * * %GST_FLOW_NOT_LINKED: only if all returns are NOT_LINKED too
 * * %GST_FLOW_ERROR or below: if at least one returns an error return
 * * %GST_FLOW_NOT_NEGOTIATED: if at least one returns a not-negotiated return
 * * %GST_FLOW_FLUSHING: if at least one returns flushing
 * * %GST_FLOW_OK: otherwise
 * 
 * %GST_FLOW_ERROR or below, GST_FLOW_NOT_NEGOTIATED and GST_FLOW_FLUSHING are
 * returned immediately from the gst_flow_combiner_update_flow() function.
